      <p>My name is Brandon Pitts. I live in Las Vegas, NV but I am originally from Hawaii. I worked in building maintenance/construction field and as a Range Safety Officer, since I left the Army. I went to the College of Southern Nevada for Diesel Technology and am currently attending classes for Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript at Code Fellows. I have a goal of creating a website that tracks all new NFT mints in real time for the Cardano blockchain.</p>
